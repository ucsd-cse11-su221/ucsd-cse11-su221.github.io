In this course, you will learn to write, trace, and test programs; explore the
interactions between programs and data; and practice organizing programs for
clarity and re-use.

We will explore these topics interactively in lecture, you will implement
programs to practice your programming skills, and you will reflect on this
learning through your own program designs.

This web page serves as the main source of announcements and resources for the
course, as well as the syllabus.

## Basics

- Q&A Forum: Piazza [https://piazza.com/eng.ucsd/summer2021/cse11su221/](https://piazza.com/eng.ucsd/summer2021/cse11su221/)
- Gradescope: [https://www.gradescope.com](https://www.gradescope.com) [an invitation will be sent in the first week]
- Autograder: [https://autograder.ucsd.edu/](https://autograder.ucsd.edu/)

On an average week in CSE11, you can expect to spend 8-12 hours on reading, lecture, and discussion; 
4-6 hours on programming practice; and 8-12 hours working on your programming projects. 
If you find yourself spending dramatically more time than this, it's a good idea to contact the 
course staff and discuss more efficient strategies in office hours.

<a id="b:lec"></a>

<h3>Lecture</h3>

Lecture content will be presented through live lecture and readings. All lectures will be recorded.  
Attendance is encouraged but not required. 

These will come with associated quizzes that are due on Saturday of each week. The
quizzes are required work to demonstrate your consistent engagement with the material. 

The lecture time is listed below (in the time zone of San Diego). 
The Zoom link for the lecture will be posted in Canvas.

## Staff & Resources

### Staff
<a id="staff"></a>
<p>
<a target="_blank" href="https://gregmiranda.com">Greg Miranda</a> (Instructor)
</p>

There are 6 staff members (instructor, TA, and tutors) to help with your learning, and a few kinds of help sessions
you can attend. 

The first is **1-on-1 help hours** where TAs and tutors are available to
answer your questions about any course content, though often this is a good
place to go for programming help. At the times below, the course staff will be
available to answer your questions, and it's a great place to get debugging
help, since you'll be able to 1-on-1 screenshare with a tutor.

Expect to have about 5 minutes with a tutor or TA: you probably won‚Äôt have the solution at the end of the conversation, but you should feel un-stuck and ready to try new approaches. The goal of tutoring is to get you unstuck. You can also discuss lecture content and past quizzes with the tutors.

You can see instructions for how we're setting this up for remote access here:

[Remote Lab Hours How-To](https://drive.google.com/file/d/15D8Z3re9gYDfcIGQSX7r7fc0LZBzY9cA/view?usp=sharing)

These rules help us make sure we get timely and actionable help to as many
students as possible. They also encourage students to do some meaningful work
on their own before reaching out for help ‚Äì the goal of the course is for you
to be able to do programming work on your own!

The second is through **Piazza**.

Piazza is an online discussion board where we can make announcements and
students can ask questions. Both we (the course staff) and your classmates can
answer your questions. There are a few kinds of questions you should ask on
Piazza:

- Private questions about your code related to a programming assignments
- Private questions about your grade / progress in the course
- Public questions about the content of lecture, discussion, lab, and any readings
- Public questions containing no code that relate to programming assignments

For each assignment, you will find a Frequently Asked Questions post, where we
will answer all common questions we receive in office hours and via (private)
Piazza posts. If you ask a question that‚Äôs already answered in that post, we‚Äôll
likely just send you a link to that post. That post will be updated as new
important questions and answers come in.

When answering questions, be polite, be clear, and assume the best intentions
of the person asking. If it turns out you make a mistake or were wrong, admit
it with a smile (emoji are great for this üòä), and make sure the correct
information is clear. Above all, keep in mind that the course is a community
whose goal is to foster a positive learning environment for everyone.

For public discussion, note that answers from your classmates are not official!
They could be downright wrong or misleading, completely by accident. ‚ÄúMy
classmate said so on Piazza‚Äù is not a legitimate justification in most
arguments, though they may indeed lead you in helpful directions.

<a id="grading"></a>
## Grading

There are three components to your grade in the course:

- 20% Engagement (surveys, lecture quizzes, etc)
- 50% Programming Assignments (weekly)
- 30% Exams (Code + video), 2 midterms + final
  - Best exam performance counts for 15%
  - Middle exam counts for 10%
  - Lowest exam counts for 5%
  - To pass the course, you must either pass:
    - Both midterms, or
    - The final exam

Your final letter grade will correspond to the following table:

<table class="table table-striped">
<tbody>
<tr align="center" padding="10">
<td>A+</td>
<td>A</td>
<td>A-</td>
<td>B+</td>
<td>B</td>
<td>B-</td>
<td>C+</td>
<td>C</td>
<td>C-</td>
<td>D, F</td>
</tr>
<tr align="center">
<td>&nbsp; >97&nbsp; </td>
<td>&nbsp; 93-96.99 &nbsp; </td>
<td>&nbsp; 90-92.99&nbsp; </td>
<td>&nbsp; 87-89.99&nbsp; </td>
<td>&nbsp; 83-86.99&nbsp; </td>
<td>&nbsp; 80-82.99&nbsp; </td>
<td>&nbsp; 77-79.99&nbsp; </td>
<td>&nbsp; 73-76.99&nbsp; </td>
<td>&nbsp; 65-72.99&nbsp; </td>
<td>&nbsp; Below 64.99&nbsp; </td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

We may adjust the above scale to be more lenient (depending on a number of
factors that we will not publicize), but we guarantee that we will not adjust
the scale to make it harder to get a better grade. We will not adjust the
scale for individual students.

<a id="g:engage"></a>
<h3>Engagement</h3>

Each week will come with several associated quizzes. Completing the quiz before the
due date (11:59pm San Diego time) with at least half of the answers correct gains engagement
credit. You can also get engagement credit by submitting various surveys and
other small engagement tasks we may ask of you throughout the quarter.

You need to get credit for 80% (ex: 8 out of 10 total) quizzes, surveys, or tasks for full engagement credit.

<a id="p:programming"></a>
<h3>Programming</h3>

Every week there will be a programming assignment. Direct practice with
programming will make up the majority of your work in the course.

Each programming assignment will have a portion that is automatically graded, and a portion that is manually graded by the course staff.

After each assignment's deadline, we will open a resubmission for that assignment for one week (this time period may be shorter for assignments near the end of the quarter). You can resubmit to improve your grade. The details of this process will be described along with the grades for the first programming assignment.

There are 10 PAs total, and their relative weightings that add up to 50% are:

- PA0.5: 1%
- PA1: 4%
- PA2: 5%
- PA3: 6%
- PA4: 7%
- PA5: 6%
- PA6: 3%
- PA7: 8%
- PA8: 5%
- PA9: 5%

<a id="g:exams"></a>
<h3>Exams</h3>

In place of on-paper exams, we will follow a different procedure for ‚Äúexams‚Äù
this quarter.

Twice during the quarter and once at the time of the final exam, we will give
you a short programming assignment that you must complete in a short time frame
(1-2 days) without any help from other people, including the course staff. You
can use any resources, notes, readings, and past code from the course to help
in addition to Web-based resources.  Along with submitting the program, you
will record a short video of yourself presenting the program you wrote,
demonstrating its behavior and your understanding. We'll give some
opportunities for practice with this process, and much more detailed
instructions with the exam release.

The first time will be in **week 3**, with Fri/Sat as the days to complete
it (right around PA5, August 20-21). The second time will be in **week 4** with
Fri/Sat as the days to complete it (August 27-28). The last time will be for a
few days around our final exam dates (September 3-4).

We **do not** expect that the programming work and recording will take two
days of constant work. The tasks will be significantly shorter than the PAs, so
this should only take a few hours. We give the broad range to give you the best
chance to schedule some quiet, focused time to do the work and record the
presentation.

It's worth explaining why we are using this mechanism. There are at least two
reasons:

1. Presenting your code, and demonstrating it via screenshare, is a really
important skill and shows us a lot of your learning. Getting practice with this
style of presentation is a good thing for you to learn in general and a rich
way for us to assess your skills.
2. The main thing that in-person, on-paper exams let us do is easily verify
that it is in fact **you**, the student, completing a major assessment. We can
similarly do so with a video ‚Äì many students are concerned that cheating will
be frequent in all-remote courses, and this is our way of ensuring that we are
giving grades to the people who earned them.

We will delete all the videos we receive from you after assigning final grades
for the course, and they will be stored in a university-controlled Google Drive
directory during the quarter only accessible to the course staff.

Please send a private message on Piazza or an email to the instructor if you
have concerns about this exam policy or cannot complete exams in this style for
some reason.


<a id="policies"></a>
## Policies

### Academic Integrity

Individual assignments will describe their academic integrity requirements.
This have a [missive on academic integrity](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1F6tu-82W5kFkEkZG8n4F7p-MLhyFVWLdPw5Tm1fABfM/edit?folder=1jNMUNlJuyXaOxDE5MdNNfRFARxfP40Rr#)	
has some details some examples of what we expect in terms of collaboration in the
course.

Note that with the course remote, one challenge we face as an instructional
team is verifying that students are submitting their own work. We typically use
exams to mitigate this particular challenge to academic integrity, since it
requires an in-person, ID-checked assessment. Assignments and exams will come
with specific policies for what types of collaboration is allowed, but we have
one course-wide policy ‚Äì we may reach out to students to schedule a check-in on
their understanding of work they've submitted if we're suspicious about an
academic integrity violation. This would involve a videoconference with a TA or
instructor to check that the student has the understanding demonstrated by
their work.

We don't expect to use this option much (certainly **you** are a student that
acts with integrity!), but we state it clearly in the syllabus in case it
becomes necessary so it isn't a surprise to anyone.

You should be familiar with [the UCSD
guidelines](http://senate.ucsd.edu/Operating-Procedures/Senate-Manual/Appendices/2)
on academic integrity as well.

### Late and Missed Work

There will be opportunities to regain some (not necessarily all) lost credit on programming assignments if you submit something incomplete or miss the deadline, by resubmitting later with fixes. The details of this process will be described along with the grades for the first programming assignment.

No late work will be accepted for the programming exams. However, the combined grading policy for the exams will allow some flexibility in the event that you cannot complete one of them. 

### Regrades

Mistakes sometimes occur in grading. Once grades are posted for an assignment,
we will allow a short period for you to request a fix (announced along with
grade release). If you don't make a request in the given period, the grade you
were initially given is final.


### Diversity and Inclusion

We are committed to fostering a learning environment for this course that
supports a diversity of thoughts, perspectives and experiences, and respects
your identities (including race, ethnicity, heritage, gender, sex, class,
sexuality, religion, ability, age, educational background, etc.).  Our goal is
to create a diverse and inclusive learning environment where all students feel
comfortable and can thrive.

Our instructional staff will make a concerted effort to be welcoming and
inclusive to the wide diversity of students in this course.  If there is a way
we can make you feel more included please let one of the course staff know,
either in person, via email/discussion board, or even in a note under the door.
Our learning about diverse perspectives and identities is an ongoing process,
and we welcome your perspectives and input.

We also expect that you, as a student in this course, will honor and respect
your classmates, abiding by the UCSD Principles of Community
(https://ucsd.edu/about/principles.html).  Please understand that others‚Äô
backgrounds, perspectives and experiences may be different than your own, and
help us to build an environment where everyone is respected and feels
comfortable.

If you experience any sort of harassment or discrimination, please contact the
instructor as soon as possible.   If you prefer to speak with someone outside
of the course, please contact the Office of Prevention of Harassment and
Discrimination: https://ophd.ucsd.edu/.
